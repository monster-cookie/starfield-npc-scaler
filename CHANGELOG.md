# V1.0 Permutations

## V1.0.4
* Scaling by NPC race (Human, Robot, Critter, Creature) and default as a fall back. Default/Human/Robot are enabled with base=.1, scaleMin=0.8, scaleMax=1.1; Critter is disabled with base=0, scaleMin=0.4, scaleMax=0.8; finally Creature is disabled with base=0, scaleMin=0.6, scaleMax=0.9;
* Base is a true generic base that adjust for difficulty using multipliers are 0 for Very Easy, 1 for Easy, 3 for Normal, 6 for hard, 12 for very hard, 30 for TSV.
* Easter egg mode for each race that pseudo brings our critter overlords but only a 5% chance of happening. I would only enable on critter as it increases min by 25% and max by 50%.

## V1.0.3
* In PEX land evaluating the keywords and excluding all CCT NPCs from scaling, like critters they become super creature mutants.
* Requires Venpi's Core Utilities 1.0.6 or newer 

## V1.0.2
* Stat scaling will no longer be applied to critters (via race and keyword)

## V1.0.1
* Imported some game settings from Dynamic Scaling.
